## Data Modeling

After Analyzing the given csv files under the [Resources Folder](Resources) and create an Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD) using the tool [ERD Tool](https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) and the screenshot of the diagram is here. [ERD.png](EmployeeSQL/ERD.png)

## Data Engineering

Based on the ERD Diagram, created the database schema. Schema File is as shown here -[Schema](EmployeeSQL/Schema.sql)

Imported the data from csv files to the database using the in-built import function in PGAdmin in a specific order to not violate foreign key constraints.
